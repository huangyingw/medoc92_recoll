How to migrate to another mac?

The default font and outlook of recoll, on macos is very terrible.
It tooks me lots of efforts to customize it to my favorite, on one mac.

Is it possible to migrate/copy my custom setting from one mac to another mac?

I have tried copying following folder, but no luck:(
    ~/.recoll/
    /opt/local/share/recoll/



Highlight color for query terms: Terms from the user query are highlighted in the result list samples and the preview window. The color can be chosen here. Any Qt color string should work (ie red, #ff0000). The default is blue.

Style sheet: The name of a Qt style sheet text file which is applied to the whole Recoll application on startup. The default value is empty, but there is a skeleton style sheet (recoll.qss) inside the /usr/share/recoll/examples directory. Using a style sheet, you can change most recoll graphical parameters: colors, fonts, etc. See the sample file for a few simple examples.

You should be aware that parameters (e.g.: the background color) set inside the Recoll GUI style sheet will override global system preferences, with possible strange side effects: for example if you set the foreground to a light color and the background to a dark one in the desktop preferences, but only the background is set inside the Recoll style sheet, and it is light too, then text will appear light-on-light inside the Recoll GUI.

On Mac OS, the GUI-related preferences are stored in 
    ~/.config/Recoll.org/recoll.ini
    , same as on Linux.
It's only different on Windows (c:/users/[me]/AppData/Roaming/Recoll.org/recoll.ini)

Maybe I could change the default font on the Mac. What customisations are you using ?

I don't have this file on my mac. I even used this command to search, nothing found:(
````
    sudo find / -type f -name recoll.ini -maxdepth 7
````

My recoll version info:
````
    Recoll 1.25.22 + Xapian 1.4.14
````
My Macos version info:
````
    11.5.1        
````

Thanks for your offering to change the default font.
My customisations is more than font, so, if there is a configuration folder I could copy from, that would be great.

I searched for recoll.conf
````
sudo find / -type f -name recoll.conf -maxdepth 7 2>/dev/null
    /System/Volumes/Data/Users/huangyingw/.recoll/recoll.conf
    /Users/huangyingw/.recoll/recoll.conf
    /opt/local/share/recoll/examples/recoll.conf
````
and copied the following folders to another mac,
````
    ~/.recoll/
    /opt/local/share/recoll/
````
, and launch recoll in that mac, no luck:(

Can you please run ls -l in ~/.config/Recoll.org/  ?

I would have expected a recoll.conf file to be in there, but, oops, recoll 1.25 used the 'NativeFormat' for the GUI preferences, so Qt uses another location. 
I should have reread the Qt documentation (for my excuse, this recoll version is now several years old).
So, hopefully, you should find  a *.recoll.plist file in ~/Library/Preferences/

great thanks, yes, it is this file:
````
    ~/Library/Preferences/org.recoll.recoll.plist
````
after copying it to another mac, and re-launch recoll, it work.
I am trying to build from git cloned source, if I have trouble, will ask you.

where is the default config location in latest master branch?
````
    ~/.recoll/ ?
````

If you want to build from the current source, I'd recommend having a look at the mac page:
